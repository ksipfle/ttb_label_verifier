# TTB LABEL VERIFIER

Web app to replace manual inspection of liquor labels.

Key Objectives:
- Build a web UI for inputting form data (some key fields from a TTB label application) and uploading an
 image of an alcohol label. DONE.
- Implement a backend service that uses basic AI (e.g. OCR or image analysis) to extract information from
 the label image. DONE.
- Compare the extracted label information with the form inputs and determine if they match (just like a TTB
 agent would verify a label). DONE.
- Display clear results to the user indicating success (if everything matches) or failure (if discrepancies are
 found), along with details on what was verified. DONE.
- Ensure the app handles various scenarios (matching info, mismatched info, missing fields on the label,
 unreadable image, etc.) gracefully and clearly. BASICS.

Mostly generated by prompting ChatGPT.  Front end is html and back end is python.
Backend uses django and pytesseract.

Did development on Xubuntu linux on WSL and the webserver is on linux Centos 8.
Ran ChatGPT from Chrome on Windows.

"Deployment: We’d like to see the app deployed live."
Running at http://142.11.238.224 on django web server on a server I have for website 
tinkering. Ran it on nginx in the past but "The app doesn’t need to handle heavy traffic" 

"This project is intended to be completed in about one day, so scope your solution 
accordingly."
"Feel free to note how you would extend it if given more time"
Exercise it more and make it robust and make it prettier, to the degree the ROI and 
opportunity cost are good.

"Feel free to mention any bonus features you implement (or attempted) in your documentation 
so we don’t overlook them."
I spent time trying to get any decent recognition of real labels from tesseract 
with preprocessing help from PIL.  My conclusion is that for various (many) photographs from
 bottles these tools are too weak and flaky.  Would need to try on submitted fresh flat 
actual labels or images thereof.
